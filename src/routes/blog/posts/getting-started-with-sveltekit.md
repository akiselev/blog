# Getting Started with SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a powerful framework for building web applications. In this post, we'll explore the basics of getting started with SvelteKit and why it might be the right choice for your next project.

## Why SvelteKit?

SvelteKit combines the power of Svelte with a full-featured application framework. Here are some key benefits:

- Zero-config deployment to various platforms
- Excellent developer experience
- Built-in routing and layouts
- Server-side rendering out of the box

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new SvelteKit project, run:

```bash
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

## Basic Project Structure

A typical SvelteKit project has the following structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── +page.svelte
│   ├── lib/
│   └── app.html
├── static/
└── package.json
```

## Next Steps

In future posts, we'll dive deeper into:
- Route parameters and dynamic routes
- Data loading with load functions
- Server-side rendering vs client-side rendering
- Deployment strategies
